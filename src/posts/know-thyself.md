# Know thyself

After a conversation with friends this weekend I started thinking about how we decide to spend our time and money. The conversation centred around a friend-of-a-friend who spends an inordinate amount of money on parts and upgrades for a car that itself is in the same price range as the flat me and my wife live in. It's not so much about being flashy, I gathered, but more about this guy's insane level of interest and passion for this particular make and model of car.

This absolutely blew my mind. And got me thinking, "Why don't I have a hobby or obsession like that?". Why don't I have something that I would be willing to drop cold, hard cash for in the blink of an eye? Do I not have passions or interests? Or is that guy the weirdo?

I'm not into watches or TVs, or specced up computers. Or cars or bikes. Neither am I obsessed with shoes, jewellery, expensive whiskies or collecting anything in particular. Hell, the most expensive 'thing' I have is probably this laptop I'm typing on right now, and the only reason I have it is because I need it for work, not because I'm particularly passionate about it.

Sadly, this seemingly inconsequential little conundrum occupied more of my mental energy this weekend than I'd like to admit(yet here I am ðŸ˜€). As Socrates said, "The unexamined life is not worth living." Why? Because know what makes you excited, passionate and happy is a why to keep yourself engaged in life. It helps keeps boredom and depression at bay. It helps you make hard choices when life forces you to choose a path, and it helps create clarity in those opaque and ambiguous situations where you're presented with a set of decision you need to make and you have no idea what to do.

Knowing what lights your fire is an important compass to have. So, driving back this the weekend, I started thinking about this and slowly realised something about myself that I think will be useful when I inevitably come across those little where I have to weigh up opportunity costs when decisions inconveniently present themselves.

I realised that I value experiences and learning above having and acquiring objects and things. And I am not into learning anything in particular or specific - I don't want to be the best chess player in the world - I just love the novelty of learning new things that I consider either useful or rewarding. I do not get excited or feel proud of having things considered to be the 'best' or about building a collection of particular things of value. I'm not obsessed about being the best at some activity either.

I thought a bit about the kind of things I really enjoyed doing the last couple of years. There were some seemingly disparate and unconnected things, but on closer inspection united by a similar theme;

- Me and my wife travelled overseas for the first time. This was ridiculously eye-opening and exciting. I would spend more money than I could reasonably afford on this again in a heartbeat.
- I enrolled in a degree completely out of my field of expertise - business - and learned a lot. It was frustrating, time-consuming, expensive and... awesome.
- I changed careers, at a relatively mature age, from animation and VFX to development. What a ride.
- I started learning Spanish, and I'm nowhere near a Spanish speaking country. (I have not really gotten very far with that, the degree got in the way)
- I learned how to safely handle, clean and use firearms. I discovered however, that I do not want to own, keep or collect them. I was just after the knowledge and experience.

And that was my realisation - I value knowledge and experiences above _things_. At least for now.

This lead me to consider how I should plan out life in order to keep me happier and engaged in life more going forward, how to motivate myself when live gets overly stressful or tedious.

So, to conclude, here are some of the things I want to do the next year or so;

- Learning to drive and get a license for a large motorcycle - I do not want a motorcycle, and that's OK.
- Continue learning Spanish.
- Learn to weld.
- Learn to dive.
- Learn how to service my own car.
- Learn how to wire and install residential electricity.
- Go for an advanced driving course.
- Get over my fear of heights by going indoor and outdoor climbing.
- Travel again.

What makes you happy? Have you seriously though about it? Do you actively pursue it?
